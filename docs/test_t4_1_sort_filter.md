# T4.1 Sort & Filter Testing Guide

## Overview
This guide tests the newly implemented sort and filter functionality in the Recent Saves component.

## Features Implemented
1. **Database-level sorting** by `created_at` (Latest/Earliest) and `source` (Source)
2. **Provider filtering** via dropdown menu with GitHub, Twitter, Reddit, StackOverflow
3. **Immediate UI updates** when controls are changed
4. **Clear filters** functionality
5. **Improved "no bookmarks" handling** for filtered results
6. **Fixed bulk selection** UI breaking issues

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Sort Functionality

2. Verify "Latest" button is active (highlighted)
3. Verify bookmarks are sorted by creation date (newest first)
4. Note the order of bookmarks

#### Test 1.2: Sort by Earliest
1. Click "Earliest" button

2. Verify the list updates immediately without page refresh
3. Verify loading states are handled properly

#### Test 6.2: Dropdown Interaction
1. Open filter dropdown and make selections
2. Verify immediate updates as checkboxes are clicked
3. Verify smooth dropdown open/close animations

## Expected Database Queries

When testing, the following Supabase queries should be generated:

### Sort by Latest (Default)
```sql
SELECT * FROM bookmarks 
WHERE user_id = ? 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 10 OFFSET 0
```

### Sort by Earliest
```sql
SELECT * FROM bookmarks 
WHERE user_id = ? 
ORDER BY created_at ASC 
LIMIT 10 OFFSET 0
```

### Sort by Source
```sql
SELECT * FROM bookmarks 
WHERE user_id = ? 
ORDER BY source ASC 
LIMIT 10 OFFSET 0
```

### Filter by GitHub
```sql
SELECT * FROM bookmarks 
WHERE user_id = ? AND source IN ('github')
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 10 OFFSET 0
```

### Filter by Multiple Providers
```sql
SELECT * FROM bookmarks 
WHERE user_id = ? AND source IN ('github', 'twitter')
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 10 OFFSET 0
```

## UI Elements to Verify

### Sort Controls
- [ ] "Latest" button (Calendar icon)
- [ ] "Earliest" button (Calendar icon)  
- [ ] "Source" button (TrendingUp icon)

## Success Criteria

âœ… **T4.1 Complete** when:
1. All sort options work and update the list immediately
2. Filter dropdown works with multi-select functionality
3. Filters can be combined and cleared via dropdown
4. Sort and filter work together correctly
5. Database queries are optimized (sorting/filtering at DB level)
6. UI is responsive and provides good user feedback
7. No console errors or TypeScript issues
8. Proper "no bookmarks" handling for filtered results
9. Bulk selection doesn't break UI with filter changes

## Notes for Testing

- Test with both real bookmarks (if available) and mock data
- Verify behavior when no bookmarks match filters (shows specific message)
- Check that bulk selection mode disables sort/filter controls
- Ensure search results are not affected by these controls (search has its own relevance ordering)
- Test dropdown behavior: open/close, click outside, keyboard navigation
- Verify filter badge updates correctly with selection count
