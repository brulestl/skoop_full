# RLS Policy Status Report

## 🔍 Current Situation

The migration ran successfully, but it revealed that there were **already existing RLS policies** on the `connected_accounts` table. This resulted in **duplicate policies** with different naming conventions.

## 📊 Policy Analysis

### Existing Policies (Before Our Migration)
- ✅ "Users can delete their own connected accounts" (DELETE)
- ✅ "Users can insert their own connected accounts" (INSERT) 
- ✅ "Users can only access their own connected accounts" (ALL)
- ✅ "Users can update their own connected accounts" (UPDATE)
- ✅ "Users can view their own connected accounts" (SELECT)

### Our New Policies (From Migration)
- ✅ "user_delete_own_accounts" (DELETE)
- ✅ "user_insert_own_accounts" (INSERT)
- ✅ "user_select_own_accounts" (SELECT)
- ✅ "user_update_own_accounts" (UPDATE)

## 🎯 Policy Functionality

**Good News**: All policies have the correct logic `(user_id = auth.uid())` or `(auth.uid() = user_id)`, so RLS is working properly regardless of the duplicates.

**Issue**: Having duplicate policies is redundant and can cause confusion.

## 🧹 Cleanup Required

Run the cleanup script to remove the old policies and keep our new ones with consistent naming:

```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:
-- Copy content from: supabase/cleanup_duplicate_rls_policies.sql
```

## 📋 Expected Final State

After cleanup, you should have exactly **4 policies**:

| Policy Name | Operation | Condition |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| user_select_own_accounts | SELECT | `(user_id = auth.uid())` |
| user_insert_own_accounts | INSERT | `WITH CHECK (user_id = auth.uid())` |
| user_update_own_accounts | UPDATE | `USING (user_id = auth.uid()) WITH CHECK (user_id = auth.uid())` |
| user_delete_own_accounts | DELETE | `(user_id = auth.uid())` |

## 🔒 Security Status

**Current Security Level**: ✅ **SECURE**
- RLS is enabled on the table
- All policies correctly restrict access to user's own data
- OAuth tokens are protected from unauthorized access

**Impact of Duplicates**: ❌ **No security impact** - PostgreSQL applies all matching policies, so having duplicates doesn't weaken security.

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Run cleanup script**: `supabase/cleanup_duplicate_rls_policies.sql`
2. **Verify final state**: Should show 4 policies with our naming convention
3. **Test functionality**: RLS should continue working as expected
4. **Proceed with testing**: Use the test scripts to verify everything works

## 💡 Why This Happened

This suggests that:
1. RLS was previously implemented on this table
2. The existing implementation was working correctly
3. Our migration added additional policies with better naming conventions
4. Both sets of policies are functionally equivalent

The cleanup will simply remove the redundant policies while maintaining the same security level.
